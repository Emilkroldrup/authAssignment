# Project Overview: Advanced REST API for User Management

## Introduction

Hey there! This is my Advanced REST API project, built to manage users, roles, and authentication securely. Itâ€™s been quite the journey, and I want to walk you through the core features, the decisions I made, and the challenges I tackled along the way. My goal was to build a scalable, well-documented, and secure API, and Iâ€™ve learned a ton throughout this process. Let's dive in!

## Project Features

- **User Registration and Authentication**: Users can register with different roles and securely log in.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Each user is assigned a role (`soldier`, `officer`, `admin`) that dictates their access level within the app.
- **JWT Authentication**: I started with a simple JWT implementation using the `jsonwebtoken` library, but then decided to take on the challenge of building my own JWT functions. This was to really understand how JWT works under the hood.
- **API Documentation with Swagger**: Full Swagger documentation for easy integration.
- **Frontend Integration**: The backend API is ready to connect smoothly with a Next.js frontend, which Iâ€™ve already started on.

## Folder Structure Overview

To keep things modular and easy to maintain, I organized the backend into several folders:

- **`backend/src/config`**: Handles database configuration and connection.
- **`backend/src/controllers`**: Manages user-related actions like registration, login, and role management.
- **`backend/src/middleware`**: Contains middleware for JWT and role validation.
- **`backend/src/models`**: Mongoose models for MongoDB.
- **`backend/src/routes`**: Defines all the endpoints related to authentication.

I've also set up a **frontend** folder for the Next.js TypeScript application, making it easy to navigate between backend and frontend work.

## Key Architectural Changes and Challenges

### 1. JWT Token Management

Originally, I used the `jsonwebtoken` library for token generation and verification. It worked fine, but I wanted to take things a step further and really learn how JWT works. So, I challenged myself to build the token generation and verification from scratch.

Now, I manually create and sign the tokens, handle the encoding, and verify their integrity, which has given me a much deeper understanding of JWT, hashing, and payload security.

### 2. Separation of JWT Logic

Once I started manually creating and verifying tokens, I decided to extract the JWT-related functionality into a dedicated utility file (`jwtUtils.js`). This makes the authentication controller (`authController`) cleaner and easier to maintain:

- **`generateJWT`**: Manually creates tokens, includes expiration time, and securely signs them.
- **`verifyJWT`**: Manually verifies tokens, checking for tampering and expiration.

### 3. Middleware Enhancements

I also updated the **authentication middleware** to use my custom `verifyJWT` function, ensuring consistency throughout the application. I then added a **role-based middleware** (`roleMiddleware`) to restrict certain routes to specific user roles, like admins only.

### 4. Role-Based Access Control

The project now has a clear structure that defines which roles have access to what. For example, the `/api/auth/admin` route requires the user not only to be authenticated but also to have the `admin` role.

## Backend Features Walkthrough

- **Registration**: Users can register using the `/api/auth/register` endpoint. I used **Joi** for validation to enforce password strength and username requirements.
- **Login**: The `/api/auth/login` endpoint lets users log in. If the credentials are valid, a JWT token is generated and sent as an **HTTP-only cookie** for security.
- **JWT Verification**: Protected routes are secured with JWT verification via `authMiddleware`, ensuring the token is valid and hasnâ€™t expired.
- **Role Middleware**: Some routes require extra checksâ€”like the admin-only `/api/auth/admin` route, which uses `roleMiddleware` to verify the user's role.

## Frontend Integratio

Iâ€™ve set up a **Next.js** frontend in **TypeScript** that consumes the backend API. It includes forms for **user registration** and **login**, and uses **Axios** to communicate with the backend. JWT tokens are set as **HTTP-only cookies** to enhance security and prevent XSS attacks. I plan to use **React Context** for managing the authentication state, ensuring users are seamlessly redirected based on their roles.

## Future Improvements

- **Frontend Protected Routes**: Iâ€™ll be implementing protected routes using Next.js to ensure that only logged-in users with the correct role can access certain pages.
- **Session Management**: Adding a refresh token mechanism to extend user sessions securely is definitely on my list.
- **UI/UX Enhancements**: I want to make the frontend look really polished, with better styling and user-friendly error messages.

## Conclusion

This project has been all about building a complete backend setup for **secure user management** with **role-based access control** and **JWT authentication**. Moving from using a library for JWT to building my own implementation was a challenging but rewarding experience. By extracting JWT operations, using middleware for access control, and structuring the application into logical modules, Iâ€™ve created something thatâ€™s not only functional but also maintainable and scalable.

Thanks for checking out my project! If you have any questions or suggestions for improvements, Iâ€™d love to hear them. ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€
